## APMath
APMath is (will be) an arbitary math library written in C.

Why you may ask. Well why not i say. 

Do you even know C? No, no I do not.

This is my attempt to understand this language, please forgive any inefficient code and memory leaks :). 

NOTE: I do not know how to write a Makefile, this one was written by ChatGPT.
